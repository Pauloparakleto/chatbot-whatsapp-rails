#  Everton chatbot

There is a nice restaurante on my neighborhood. I friend of mine works there as the recepcionist listening on many delivery channels as possible.

Everton chatbot is a bot for whatsapp made with rails framework and cosuming a Twilio API.
This prototype simulate a talk I used to have with Everton when I ask the same food always.

## Give to it a try

Ask the Twilio number for this project in private to this repository owner. After this I'll give you the password to initialize the chatbot.

It is in portuguese so...

Things you may initially ask:

1. "Fala", to initialize the talk;
2. "Qual lanche que tem hoje?" or "Me manda o menu";
3. "De que que tem o suco?";
4. "Quanto que t√° o x bacon?

The customization is been according to Everton concerns.
